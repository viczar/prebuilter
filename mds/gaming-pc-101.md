# Gaming PCs 101

So, you want to get into PC gaming? 

If you come from consoles or you are only accuanteince with PCs as laptops. The picture of big bulky tower looking frames with a lot of RGB lights might be a bit unnerving. But fear not, as the basic of how to get up an running are not difficult what so ever.

When starting out, you can either buy a *Prebuilt* (that is, a Gaming PC already built) or you can build your computer from the bareparts yourself. This article is not about which one is better, for that you can read this. Either way you choose to take, you should be aware of the basics of Gaming PCs, and PCs in general.

# The Parts

Modern home computers have pretty standard and universal conectivity and architecture that most computers support. In general, a modern Gaming PC is composed of:

* A **Motherboard** (The board that all other components are connected to).
* A **CPU** (Central Processing Unit), usually referred as the *processor*.
* One or more **RAM** sticks, in short they provide some super fast memory that the processor can use to work with.
* A **Graphics Card**, sometimes refered as a GPU or a VGA, as its name indicated, this is the component that does mostly all graphics processing.
* Storage devices: Hard Drives or Solid State Drives, where you save your photos, games and files.
* A **PSU** (Power Supply Unit), this thing is what is connected to the wall sockets, it makes sure each component of your PC receives the exact amount of power it needs to operate.

That's it, in principle a modern PC are just those 6 things. There are also some other minor components you might have a need of:

* A **Wi-fi Card**, this is another expansion card, like you Graphics Card, that connects to the Motherboard, as its name aludes to, it provides your PC with wi-fi connectivity. A lot of modern motherboards have wi-fi connectivity built-in.
* A **Sound Card**, this card deals with sound processing. Most modern motherboards come with good sound processing support, so you probably don't need that. However, if you have some advanced sound production requirements (like, you need to get high fidelity recordings of an instrument) you might need one.
