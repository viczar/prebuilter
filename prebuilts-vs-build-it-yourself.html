                    <p>The world of gaming PCs as a plethora of issues. Probably one of the biggest pitfalls on the market is how expensive it is upfront and the fact that you need to educate yourself about some general aspects about the Hardware to make good purchasing decisions.</p>

                    <p>Naturally, as there is some amount of learning involved in the process. The internet, because it is the internet, will be full of misinformation and out right lies.</p>
                    
                    <p>So, for starter, when you decide to get into pc Gaming, you have two options: &ldquo;Build Your PC yourself&rdquo;, meaning you will buy the individual parts and assemble it yourself, or just get a premade &ldquo;prebuilt&rdquo; pc. So which one is better?</p>
                    
                    <h1>Pros/Cons about Building it yourself:</h1>
                    
                    <h2>Pros:</h2>
                    
                    <p><em>You will save some money</em> </p>
                    
                    <p>It is, usually, cheaper to buy the individual parts and assemble the PC yourself.</p>
                    
                    <p><em>You can tailor fit your PC to your needs.</em> </p>
                    
                    <p>Perhaps you need a PC with a not so powerful CPU but tons of RAM (128GB, for starters), if you do some mid level finantial analysis or machinary testing. Prebuilt PCs makers usually do not offer these kinds of options.</p>
                    
                    <p><em>You get access to a lot more non-mainstream components</em> </p>
                    
                    <p>Like weird looking cases, small form factor PCs.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Cons:</h2>
                    
                    <p><em>How do you pick which parts from which manufacturer?</em></p>
                    
                    <p>In all honestly, people say that building a PC is easy because once you have all the parts, and if everything goes well, the assembly process is for the most part just like building a big expensive lego set.</p>
                    
                    <p>However, choosing the parts to use is far from a trivial task. How much power should your PSU supply? If you are buying multiple kits of RAM, how do you make sure they all work together. How you make sure that the CPU cooler you choose fits the case you want?</p>
                    
                    <p>You can do the research and find answers to all those questions, but more often than not you will find misguided information, that you can only detect after some time of experience.</p>
                    
                    <p><em>What do you do if your PC doesn&#39;t boot up after you assemble it?</em></p>
                    
                    <p>Now, imagine you figure out what parts to get, you bought them all, and you assembled your computer&hellip; And then it doesn&#39;t boot up.</p>
                    
                    <p>Clearly, that means that at least on of the components you got was faulty, how do you figure out which one was?</p>
                    
                    <p>As you probably only have access to your single components, you can&#39;t easily test out each component on another machine to see which one is faulty (also, you probably should never do that anyway, see bellow).</p>
                    
                    <p>There is also the possibility, that one faulty component might fry another one. For example, a faulty motherboard can easily fry the CPU and RAM, a faulty PSU could fry everything. And usually the warranty of each part is for that part only, if it was destroyed because of another faulty part, you warranty will most likely not cover it.</p>
                    
                    <h1>Pros/Cons Buying a Prebuilt</h1>
                    
                    <h2>Pros:</h2>
                    
                    <p><em>It just works</em></p>
                    
                    <p>You don&#39;t have to learn basically anything about how the inner hardware works (although that wouldn&#39;t hurt) to use the system.</p>
                    
                    <p><em>One single warranty</em></p>
                    
                    <p>If you are going to spend $1000+ on a computer to play games, you will probably want a good warranty for it. One nice thing about prebuilts is that if the thing just stops working, the company that assembled it will have to answer for it. It doesn&#39;t matter who made the component that stopped working.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Cons:</h2>
                    
                    <p><em>Prebuilts are more expensive</em></p>
                    
                    <p>The company that assembled the system will charge you more than if you just built it yourself.</p>
                    
                    <p><em>Companies that make prebuilts are usually pretty terrible</em></p>
                    
                    <p>As the companies that make prebuild computers often assume you know nothing about computers, many times they will try to rip you off, and sell you a PC branded as &ldquo;gaming&rdquo; full of old hardware and terrible quality parts, and they will chage you a premium for them. That&#39;s the reason why I made this site, to list some actually good quality prebuilts.</p>
                    
                    <p>Seriously, ask someone that knows if a PC is good or just a ripoff before you buy it. Or check lists of curated PCs like this one.</p>
